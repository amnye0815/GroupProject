Title: Meal Plan Made Simple

Description: A random meal generator for users to try new recipes considering dietary restrictions. 
You can set up a profile that allows you to favorite recipes to create a Meal Plan. Recipes will come
from an API that has recipes considering all dietary restrictions that you can scan through via arrows on either side of the page.
 You will be able to create a user, create a profile, edit and update your profile information, delete your profile, and 
favorite recipes that will be displayed on your profile. This will act as your "cart" of sorts that can store and remove 
the recipes you like or would like to try.
